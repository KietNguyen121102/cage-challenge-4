## The Technical Cooperation Program (TTCP)
"The Technical Cooperation Program (TTCP) is a collaborative five-nation forum between UK, USA, Canada, Australia and New Zealand."

"It provides a forum for the sharing of ideas and the harmonisation of programs. This gives member nations the potential to extend their research and development (R&D) capabilities at minimal cost, to avoid duplication and to improve interoperability." - [_DSTG (AU)_](https://www.dst.defence.gov.au/partnership/technical-cooperation-program)
